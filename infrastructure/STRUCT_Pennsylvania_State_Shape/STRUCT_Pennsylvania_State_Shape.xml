                        <othercit>This dataset contains point features representing some types of
							courthouse buildings in the U.S., Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin
							Islands. This includes county courthouses, state supreme courthouses,
							and the Supreme Court of the United States. The purpose is to document
							the spatial location and physical address of courthouse buildings for
							general cartographic representation purposes on USGS mapping products at
							1:24,000 scale. This dataset does not contain appellate courts, federal
							courts, tribal courts, municipal, village, or town courts, specialty
							courts (e.g., family, probate, juvenile, or bankruptcy courts), or
							historic courthouse buildings which no longer function as an active
							court. The information in this dataset was collected between 2017 and
							2018 by volunteers through the USGS The National Map Corps (TNMCorps)
							crowdsourcing project. Although these data and associated metadata have
							been reviewed for accuracy and completeness, no warranty expressed or
							implied is made regarding the display or utility of the data on any
							other system or for general or scientific purposes, nor shall the act of
							distribution constitute any such warranty. Supplemental information: The
							County level court buildings handle the bulk of county-level court
							functions, usually located in the city designated as a county seat. The
							state supreme courthouse data represents the court buildings, usually
							located in the city designated as the state capital, which house the
							ultimate judicial tribunal in a state's court system. The Supreme Court
							of the United States is represented by a single data point. County level
							courts are referred to differently in different states. The data points
							for county courthouses may also contain superior, circuit, and district
							courts where the &quot;County&quot; court designation does not apply within an
							individual state court system.</othercit>

							Village Hall, Municipal Building, Municipal Center, City Building or
							similar designation. The purpose of this dataset is to document the
							spatial location of such buildings for general cartographic
							representation purposes on USGS mapping products at 1:24,000 scale.
							Supplemental information: Excluded are county, state, or federal level
							administration buildings or historical buildings that are no longer used

							at this time. Additions and updates are provided by volunteers through
